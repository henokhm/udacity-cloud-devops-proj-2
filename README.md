### Project Title - Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation

In this project, we deploy web servers for a highly available web app using CloudFormation. The scripts create and deploy the networking infrastructure, servers and application in a completely automated manner.

The deployment includes a Virtual Private Cloud, two public and two private Subnets in two different AZs, NAT Gateways, a Load Balancer and an Auto Scaling Group. The Auto Scaling Group is configured to run 4 to 6 servers that serve the web application.
